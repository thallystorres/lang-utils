# Lang-Utils

Lang-Utils is a software project designed for data analysis using GitHub APIs. Developed primarily in Python, it leverages essential libraries such as `requests` for HTTP communication and `pandas` for data manipulation. The project includes Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files to enable interactive exploration and visualization of retrieved data.

## Development

The motivation behind Lang-Utils was to create an efficient way to extract and analyze data from GitHub repositories. Python was chosen for its simplicity and vast ecosystem of data-processing tools. The `requests` library is responsible for handling API requests to retrieve relevant information, while `pandas` facilitates the structuring, cleaning, and analysis of the collected data.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary language used for scripting and data analysis.

- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for executing code, visualizing results, and documenting analyses.

- Requests: A Python library for performing HTTP requests, essential for interacting with GitHub’s APIs.

- Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation, providing robust tools for handling structured data efficiently.

## File Structure

The repository is structured into key directories for better organization and modularity:

- classes/: Contains Python class definitions encapsulating data retrieval and processing logic.

- csvs/: Stores CSV files with raw or processed datasets for analysis and reference.

- exs/: Includes example scripts demonstrating practical usage of the project’s functionalities.

- notebooks/: Houses Jupyter Notebook files that provide step-by-step documentation, code execution, and data visualizations.

This organization ensures clarity, ease of maintenance, and a structured approach to data analysis, making it easier for contributors and users to engage with the project effectively.
